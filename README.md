# No Brakes Valet 3D: A Fistful of Lunch Money

Perhaps even more anticipated than _Half Life 3_, _No Brakes Valet 3D: A Fistful of Lunch Money_ is a 3D spiritual sequel to the colossal hit _No Brakes Valet_.

This game is being produced by fans of the original who in no way wish to 'rip-off' the amazing work of Justin Smith ([@manbearcar](https://twitter.com/manbearcar)).
